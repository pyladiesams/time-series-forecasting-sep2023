    "EnerNed is a regional transmission organization in the United States. It is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid operating an electric transmission system in various states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company noticed that sometimes it is hard for them to assume what the future demand for power will be. They would like to have a predictive model that would help them in being ready for the increase in demand as well as regulating the transmission in the system once the demand is lower. They would like to also understand how the trends are shaped over time.\n",

    "The hourly power consumption data comes from EnerNed's website and are in megawatts (MW). Follow the steps below to create a time series model. Please fill the code in the cells where indicated. Don’t worry about the time. If you don’t manage to finish all the exercises, you can always do it at home and compare your answers with the solutions provided in our repository.\n",

This can have several implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Out-of-Sample Performance__: The model's performance on the test data (and potentially on out-of-sample data within the testing period) might be reasonably accurate due to the availability of lag and rolling window features during evaluation. However, this performance doesn't guarantee how well the model will generalize to future periods when those features cannot be created.\n",
    "- __Potential Performance Drop-off__: The model's performance may degrade when forecasting into the future without the lag and rolling window features. This is because the model has learned to rely on those specific features to make predictions, and without them, it might struggle to capture certain patterns or trends.\n",
    "- __Reduced Feature Space__: In the real-world scenario, if you cannot create lag and rolling window features, you'll be limited to using only the features available at that time (e.g., the 5 features you mentioned). This means the model might not have access to all the information it was trained on, which can limit its forecasting accuracy."
